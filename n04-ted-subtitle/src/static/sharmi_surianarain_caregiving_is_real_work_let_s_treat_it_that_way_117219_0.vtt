00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:03.916
世界各地的人們每天花費 160 億小時
Every day, people around the world
spend 16 billion hours

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:05.460
關於無酬護理工作——
on unpaid care work --

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.879
為家人做飯，為他們打掃衛生，
cooking for their families,
cleaning up after them,

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.089
照顧孩子和年長的親戚
caring for children and older relatives

00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:12.633
以及所有其他日常家務勞動。
and all the other routine household tasks.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:16.554
這些活動在每個國家、每時每刻都在發生
These activities are happening all day,
at every hour, in every country

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:17.764
世界各地。
around the world.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:19.974
但因為許多人並沒有因為這份工作而獲得報酬
But because many
don't get paid for this work,

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:21.476
我們大多數人都認為這是理所當然的。
most of us take it for granted.

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:24.854
[我們的工作方式]
[The Way We Work]

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:30.026
護理工作是所有任務和雜務的總稱
Care work is a catch-all term
for all the tasks and chores

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:32.070
是為他人服務而完成的。
that are done in service of other people.

00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:36.240
有些護理工作是有報酬的，例如醫藥、護理或保姆，
Some care work is paid, like medicine,
nursing or being a nanny,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.826
但大量的工作是免費的。
but a tremendous amount is done for free.

00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:42.371
而這種無償照護工作絕大多數是由女性完成的。
And this unpaid care work
is overwhelmingly done by women.

00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:44.499
我的一生中有過很多女人
There have been so many
women in my own life

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.126
誰提供有償和無償照護工作。
who provided both paid
and unpaid care work.

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:49.212
我的母親和我的祖母在她面前。
My mother and my grandmother before her.

00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:52.048
埃斯瓦里（Eswari）在我祖母的最後幾年照顧她。
Eswari, who was nursing
my grandmother in her final years.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.259
帕特里夏，當我出差時照顧我的孩子。
Patricia, who cares for my children
when I travel for work.

00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:57.512
我也曾是無薪照顧者
And I've been an unpaid caregiver, too,

00:00:57.512 --> 00:00:59.388
照顧我的直系親屬，
caring for my immediate family,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.476
也花了幾個月的時間照顧生病的朋友和他們的孩子
but also spending several months
caring for ailing friends, their children

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:05.394
和我父親最後的日子。
and my dad in his last days.

00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:07.897
我開始意識到無償照護工作
I've come to realize that unpaid care work

00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:10.108
使所有其他工作成為可能。
makes all other work possible.

00:01:10.108 --> 00:01:11.567
新冠肺炎疫情期間，
During the COVID pandemic,

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.946
隨著學校的關閉和醫療保健系統的壓力，
with the closure of schools
and the strain on the health care system,

00:01:14.987 --> 00:01:19.617
用於無償照護和家務勞動的時間增加了一倍
the amount of time spent on unpaid care
and domestic work doubled

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:20.993
對於工作的父母來說。
for working parents.

00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:23.955
這對世界各地的女性來說都是一場災難。
This has been a disaster
for women around the world.

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:25.206
加劇壓力
Compounding the stress

00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:28.417
並將數百萬人完全趕出有償勞動市場。
and pushing millions out of the paid
labor market altogether.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:31.879
它將進步的時間倒退了幾十年。
It set the clock back
on progress by decades.

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.339
但同時，
But at the same time,

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:35.633
疫情也讓護理工作變得引人注目。
the pandemic also made care work visible.

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:38.136
它出現在我們 Zoom 通話的背景中
It showed up in the background
of our Zoom calls

00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:40.096
以及我們需要限制加班。
and in our need to limit overtime.

00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:42.515
許多工作場所能夠整合
And so many workplaces
were able to integrate

00:01:42.557 --> 00:01:44.725
甚至慶祝這個新的現實。
and even celebrate this new reality.

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:47.311
現在，我們有一個難以置信的機會
Right now, we have
an incredible opportunity

00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:51.065
認識我們生活中的護理工作，為我們自己重新定義它
to recognize the care work in our lives,
reframe it for ourselves

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:54.402
並建立更適應它的工作場所。
and build workplaces that are much
more accommodating of it.

00:01:54.443 --> 00:01:55.903
我們可以從這裡開始。
And here's where we can start.

00:01:55.903 --> 00:01:58.614
如果您是提供照護的人，
If you are someone providing care,

00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:03.077
你能做的最重要的事情就是為自己和他人命名。
the biggest thing you can do is name it
for yourself and for others.

00:02:03.077 --> 00:02:04.287
護理工作。
Care work.

00:02:04.328 --> 00:02:05.872
這不是一種幹擾
It's not a distraction

00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:07.957
如果你適合有償就業。
if you're fitting it
around paid employment.

00:02:07.957 --> 00:02:09.375
你沒有“休息”
You're not "taking a break"

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:11.961
如果你在休假期間照顧有需要的人。
if you’re on sabbatical
caring for someone in need.

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.338
這是真正的、關鍵的工作
This is real, critical work

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.884
這可能會令人筋疲力盡、令人沮喪甚至無聊。
that can be exhausting,
frustrating and even boring.

00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:20.887
允許自己感受所有你會感受到的情緒
Give yourself permission to feel
all of the emotions you'd feel

00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:23.055
如果工作伴隨著薪水。
if the work came
accompanied by a paycheck.

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:25.391
當你和你的經理談論這件事時
And when you're talking
to your manager about it,

00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:27.268
不覺得你需要道歉。
don't feel like you need to apologize.

00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:28.853
請記住，這是生活的事實，
Remember, this is a fact of life,

00:02:28.853 --> 00:02:31.230
並儘可能明確地表達您的需求。
and be as explicit as you can
about your needs.

00:02:31.272 --> 00:02:32.899
需要在家待三個月嗎
Do you need three months at home

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.735
或者您需要在周二早上進行長期預約嗎？
or do you need Tuesday mornings
for a standing appointment?

00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:36.986
作為一名護理人員，
As a caregiver,

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:41.240
認識到您在這項工作中獲得的技能也很重要。
it's also important to recognize
the skills that you gain doing this work.

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:43.659
提供護理涉及很多事情——
There is so much involved
with giving care --

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:45.912
處理運輸、物流、
handling transport, logistics,

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:48.581
解釋醫療圖表，管理財務。
interpreting medical charts,
managing financials.

00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:50.124
這些都是寶貴的技能
These are valuable skills

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:52.627
與各種背景相關的內容。
that are relevant
to all kinds of contexts.

00:02:52.627 --> 00:02:56.464
因此，如果您有工作，請以這種方式向您的同事提供照顧。
So if you have a job, frame caregiving
to your colleagues that way.

00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:58.257
如果您正在尋找有償工作，
And if you’re looking for paid work,

00:02:58.257 --> 00:03:01.052
不要把它當作你生活中的一個巨大的空白。
don't treat it as a big empty
gap in your life.

00:03:01.093 --> 00:03:04.305
將其放在您的簡歷中並概述您從中獲得的技能。
Put it on your CV and outline the skills
that you've gained from it.

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:05.932
多工等技能
Skills like multitasking,

00:03:05.973 --> 00:03:07.892
專案管理或溝通。
project management or communication.

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:09.936
但當然這不只針對個人
But of course it's not just on individuals

00:03:09.977 --> 00:03:13.064
改變更廣泛的世界對護理工作的看法。
to change how the wider world
thinks about care work.

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:15.816
我們也需要雇主進行系統性變革。
We need systemic change
from employers, too.

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:17.777
雇主可以做的最重要的事情
The biggest thing that employers can do

00:03:17.777 --> 00:03:21.405
就是給員工騰出空間來談護理工作
is to make space for employees
to talk about care work

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:25.534
不會受到懲罰或被視為不那麼專注或專注。
without being penalized or seen
as less focused or dedicated.

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:28.037
照顧應該是儘早提出的話題
Caregiving should be a topic
that's brought up early

00:03:28.037 --> 00:03:30.206
當新員工第一次開始培訓時。
when new employees
first start their training.

00:03:30.248 --> 00:03:33.084
工作場所應追蹤並了解護理工作的種類
Workplaces should track and understand
the kind of care work

00:03:33.084 --> 00:03:34.502
員工負責
employees are responsible for

00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:37.797
需要什麼樣的政策改變才能讓他們的生活變得更好
and what kind of policy changes
are needed to make their lives better

00:03:37.797 --> 00:03:38.965
並且更有生產力。
and more productive.

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:42.176
雇主應該確保照顧者不會被忽視
And employers should make sure
that caregivers aren't passed over

00:03:42.176 --> 00:03:46.055
僅僅因為他們在家裡的職責而參與關鍵項目或晉升。
for key projects or promotions
just because of their duties at home.

00:03:46.097 --> 00:03:49.350
照顧是人類的一個基本面，
Caregiving is such a fundamental
aspect of being human,

00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:52.103
然而它卻被人為地從我們的工作生活中清除掉了。
and yet it's so artificially cleansed
from our work lives.

00:03:52.144 --> 00:03:53.938
與其把它當作秘密，
Instead of treating it like a secret,

00:03:53.938 --> 00:03:55.982
工作場所可以將其公開。
workplaces can bring it out into the open.

00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:58.985
當然，工作場所需要提供靈活性
And of course, workplaces
need to offer flexibility

00:03:59.026 --> 00:04:01.612
以適應護理人員的生活現實。
to accommodate the lived
realities of caregivers.

00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:03.114
對於身為父母的員工來說，
For employees who are parents,

00:04:03.114 --> 00:04:04.573
除了育嬰假之外，
in addition to parental leave,

00:04:04.573 --> 00:04:08.035
這意味著當孩子生病或放學回家時，允許他們休息。
this means allowing them time off
when kids are sick or home from school.

00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:11.289
這意味著讓他們在日曆中建立黑暗區域
It means letting them establish
dark zones in their calendar

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.542
放學前後、洗澡時間、睡前儀式
around school drop offs,
bath time, bedtime rituals

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:16.335
並尊重這些界線。
and respecting those boundaries.

00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:18.212
這意味著提供遠端工作選項。
It means offering remote work options.

00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:21.424
對於照顧老人、病人或殘障的人來說，
For people caring for elders
or those who are sick or disabled,

00:04:21.424 --> 00:04:24.176
這意味著給予他們合理的休假時間。
this means giving them
reasonable amounts of leave.

00:04:24.218 --> 00:04:27.763
這意味著建立基於里程碑和可交付成果的項目，
It means building projects that are based
on milestones and deliverables,

00:04:27.763 --> 00:04:31.058
而不是只依靠頻繁的會議和簽到。
rather than relying on frequent
meetings and check-ins alone.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.893
這意味著非常靈活
It means being really flexible

00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:35.479
關於工作何時何地完成。
about when and where the work gets done.

00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:38.357
工作場所往往因此蓬勃發展。
And workplaces often thrive as a result.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.650
最後一點。
And one final point.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.070
護理工作是我們經濟中成長最快的部門之一。
Care work is one of the fastest-growing
sectors of our economy.

00:04:43.112 --> 00:04:45.573
由於人口增長和老化，
As a result of a growing
and an aging population,

00:04:45.614 --> 00:04:49.368
到 2030 年，世界上將有超過 20 億人需要照護。
over two billion people in the world
will need care by 2030.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.622
這意味著現在是時候改變我們照顧他們的方式了。
This means that the time is now to shift
the way we think about caring for them.

00:04:53.622 --> 00:04:56.125
人口老化將需要支持。
This aging population
is going to need support.

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:57.918
他們將需要新的解決方案。
They're going to need new solutions.

00:04:57.918 --> 00:05:01.672
這意味著創新、就業、新產業。
This means innovations,
jobs, new industries.

00:05:01.672 --> 00:05:04.467
許多其他工作都因自動化而消失，
And where many other
jobs are lost to automation,

00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:07.928
這是我們人類最擅長的工作
the one job that we're so uniquely
good at as humans

00:05:07.928 --> 00:05:09.722
關心其他人類。
is caring for other humans.
